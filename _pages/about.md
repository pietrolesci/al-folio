I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/) and I am part of the [Natural Language and Information Processing Research Group](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/) where I am working with Prof [Andreas Vlachos](https://andreasvlachos.github.io/). 
Broadly, I am interested in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I am passionate about the science of language models: developing methods—also drawing from econometrics—to study the effect of training data on models’ behaviour. Currently, I focus on active learning, data valuation, and memorisation estimation.
